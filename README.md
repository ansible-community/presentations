A GitHub repository of sharable presentations on Ansible projects for community events, excluding meetups.

## Adding a presentation

To add a new presentation:

1. Convert your presentation into a sharable PDF format.
2. Create a ``<year>`` directory if it does not already exist.
3. Add a subfolder for the event and date if there are multiple presentations (for example, ``community-day-2023.05``).
4. Alternately, for one presentation, add a ``general`` subdirectory if it does not already exist
5. Add your presentation with a descriptive filename so others can get a general understanding of 
what the presentation is about.

## Meetups and older community presentations

* See [ansible-community/meetups](https://github.com/ansible-community?q=meetup&type=all&language=&sort=)
